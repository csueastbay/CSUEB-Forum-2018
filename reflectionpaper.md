# Forum Reflection Paper
## Introduction
The reflection paper is the last assignment of the quarter and offers you a chance to think through the process of writing, about the way in which the speakers have shaped your thinking about art and design this quarter. There is no one right answer, each person will have different responses. The important thing is that your reflection links the content of the presentations to yourself and the real world in some way.

Please write a __750 - 1000 words__ reflecting on the forum this quarter. what are the themes and ideas that you are taking with you into the next year? what stood out and changed the way you think?

## Reflective Writing
Reflective tasks are challenging. Make sure you keep track of your thoughts, ideas, problems, and solutions regularly. Some lecturers will want evidence of your record-keeping. You will write a much better reflective assignment when you have your notes to work from rather than trying to brainstorm a whole lot of thoughts about what happened over a period of weeks.

## Reflective analysis can be organised in two stages and five steps:
### The first stage of reflection
1. PREPARE - Focus on an experience or event
  - What was outstanding or meaningful, negative or positive?
  - Brainstorm ideas for five minutes
  - Then consider each idea for follow up
  - Other ideas may emerge, so consider them too
  - Talk about the experience to stimulate a range of perspectives
2. DESCRIBE the experience
  - Consider the sequence, outcomes, feelings
  - Use free writing for 10 minutes
  - Create a draft that is filled with your thoughts; that explores some ideas more than others
  - Use this as a basis for a later draft that will bring in more conclusions as you continue to reflect
3. EVALUATE and conduct a critical analysis
  - How did the situation affect you?
  - Could you have reacted differently?
  - If you had, what might have happened?
  - Why did you react in that way?
  - How might this experience affect you in the future?
### The second stage of reflection
  - Seek out your key points and the issues of significance
  - The data you collected in step 3 allows you to identify the important aspects of your reflection on your learning
  - You may find that you have formed new attitudes or values.
  - Did you learn anything about yourself that was unexpected?
  - What changes do you expect to make in yourself or your work?
  - Identify solutions for similar events
  - Develop a new perspective by conceptualising the situation differently
  - Communicate the results of your reflection clearly

The reflective process is also often seen as a cycle as it is through this process that people use their learning and strive to improve by making deliberate changes to their behaviours or trying new approaches. It is very much part of the professional development process in many workplaces.

## Using Overleaf to Write LATEX (pronounced latek)
There is an video of overleaf here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8Ejj0T0yG4

There is a overview document here: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/a-quick-guide-to-latex/fghqpfgnxggz

Basically, you can write plain text in the source view and use Latex to markup the text. It will then render on the right and you can download the PDF file on the left in the project window.

## STEP-BY_STEP Guide to using the TEMPLATE
1. Create an account in Overleaf
2. Go to the overview page and UPLOAD this ZIP file [simple-reflection-paper-overleaf_template-v2.zip](simple-reflection-paper-overleaf_template-v2.zip)
