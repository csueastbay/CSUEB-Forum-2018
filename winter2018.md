|3/1/18|	THU| KRISTIN NEIDLINGER| SENSOREEs therapeutic biomedia is emotive technology that monitors the body’s systems and responds with auditory, visual, and tactile displays. The interface offers biofeedback as well as expression. SENSOREEs designs give the body a voice – self awareness, insight, communication, empathy, and fun! SENSOREE design lab crafts biometric fashions and installations promoting “extimacy” – externalized intimacy. We are an organic confluence of artists and engineers with a global network. We work with futuristic fabrics made from sustainable materials embedded with sensitive technologies. In this way, we explore the Sensory Computer Interface (SCI) – tools to enhance proximity, intimacy, telepathy, intuition, and humor between human and machine.

SENSOREE began as MFA design research to create wearable technology to augment Sensory Processing Disorder, a condition which ranges from ADHD to autism. With global enthusiasm, we have presented works at technology and healthcare conferences, in fashion shows, museums, and future visionary platforms. |
