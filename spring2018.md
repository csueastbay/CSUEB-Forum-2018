## 4/12/18 - Oree Originol

Oree Originol is an artist born on September 11 1984 in Los Angeles, Ca. As a child he discovered his talent in drawing cartoon figures at school and at home. His love for drawing and being surrounded in gang culture encouraged him to develop his skills in graffiti art. In 2009 he moved to The Bay Area that he began to exhibit his artwork in galleries and decided to develop an art career. He began an internship at Pueblo Nuevo Gallery in Berkeley, CA where he exhibited his first solo show, ‘Origin’, and provided the launching pad for his art career.

He then joined forces with the artist network CultureStrike.net and Favianna Rodriguez on projects supporting migrant rights which taught him the role of art in social activism.

On January 1, 2014 he started the ‘Justice For Our Lives’ art project, a portrait design series of people from marginalized communities who have been killed by police. His black and white portraits are set up online for download, printing and dissemination. His designs have been used in public demonstrations worldwide from San Francisco, CA to Paris, France. In the Bay Area, they where used in key demonstrations like the West Oakland BART station shutdown, OPD shut down, Mission Police Station shut down, #sayhername financial district shut down, SuperBowl City disruption, and #reclaimMLK Bay Bridge shut down among countless others. He continues developing his art and activism and sharing his skills with the Bay Area community and beyond.
