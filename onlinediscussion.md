I do not expect you to receive all information from me. Each of you holds some responsibility for what everyone learns.

Because I want diverse perspectives and everyone to become co-creators of knowledge, you need to stay on top of what is taking place here. Do not wait until the end of the week and then respond to several posts. My expectation is for everyone to log in several times a week and keep the conversations going. Remember that posts are dated and your discussions are worth 60 percent of your grade.
